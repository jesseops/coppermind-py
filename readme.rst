Coppermind is designed to be a very easy to use app allowing management of multiple ebook formats(epub, mobi, pdf, txt, etc). My goal is to allow my wife to read any ebook in our library on any of her devices by simply hitting the web frontend and clicking download on the appropriate ebook.

Once I have all the basics complete, I may also add in the concept of profiles to drive reading recommendations and possible Gutenberg integration.


:Disclaimer: The name *Coppermind* is inspired by the Feruchemical art of storing memories in copper objects found in `Brandon Sanderson's`__ Mistborn_ novels. This application is not vetted, supported, approved or known by Sanderson or any interested parties and is solely a fan tribute.
